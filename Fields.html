				<p>Mirzakhani was awarded the Fields Medal in 2014 for "her 
                    outstanding contributions to the dynamics and geometry of 
                    Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces". The award was made 
                    in Seoul at the International Congress of Mathematicians on 13 
                    August. At the time of the award, Jordan Ellenberg explained her 
                    research to a popular audience:
                    <q><em>
                        [Her] work expertly blends dynamics with geometry. Among other 
                        things, she studies billiards. But now, in a move very characteristic 
                        of modern mathematics, it gets kind of meta: She considers not just 
                        one billiard table, but the universe of all possible billiard tables. 
                        And the kind of dynamics she studies doesn't directly concern the 
                        motion of the billiards on the table, but instead a transformation of 
                        the billiard table itself, which is changing its shape in a 
                        rule-governed way; if you like, the table itself moves like a strange 
                        planet around the universe of all possible tables... This isn't the 
                        kind of thing you do to win at pool, but it's the kind of thing you 
                        do to win a Fields Medal. And it's what you need to do in order to 
                        expose the dynamics at the heart of geometry; for there's no question 
                        that they're there.
