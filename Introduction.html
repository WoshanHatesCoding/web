                        Mirzakhani was born on 12 May 1977 in Tehran, Iran. 
                        As a child, she attended Tehran Farzanegan School, 
                        part of the National Organization for Development of 
                        Exceptional Talents, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Organization_for_Development_of_Exceptional_Talents">NODET</a>. In her junior and senior 
                        years of high school, she won the gold medal for mathematics 
                        in the Iranian National Olympiad, thus allowing her to bypass 
                        the national college entrance exam. In 1994, Mirzakhani became 
                        the first Iranian woman to win a gold medal at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mathematical_Olympiad">International Mathematical Olympiad</a> 
                        in Hong Kong, scoring 41 out of 42 points. 
                        The following year, in Toronto, she became the first Iranian to 
                        achieve the full score and to win two gold medals in the International 
                        Mathematical Olympiad.

                        In 1999, she obtained a Bachelor of Science in mathematics from the 
                        Sharif University of Technology. During her time there, she received 
                        recognition from the American Mathematical Society for her work in 
                        developing a simple proof of the theorem of Schur. She then went 
                        to the United States for graduate work, earning a PhD in 2004 from 
                        Harvard University, where she worked under the supervision of the 
                        Fields Medalist, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_T._McMullen">Curtis T. McMullen</a>.
